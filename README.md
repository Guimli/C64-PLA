And yes... Another PLA for the C64. There are already too many available. But I thought they were all too big and ugly.
This version uses SOIC format components. This reduces the size of the PCB to that of a standard DIP28. And the components used are still produced, and can therefore be bought from a supplier.
To design this PLA, I used Lubomir Rintel's excellent work: https://github.com/lkundrak/yac64pla

Approximate cost for one C64-PLA (costs can reduced if you build several modules) :

(Be careful to select ATF22LV10s with an access time of 30ns. The Commodore 64 does not appreciate components that are too fast...)

- 2 x ATF22LV10CQZ-30SU  : 8.16 €
- PCB (with Shipping cost) : 23 €
- 2 x 14 pin P2.54 : 4.36 €

Total : 35.52 €

I can sell you this module if you don't want to assemble it yourself. Contact me on guimli@free.fr
